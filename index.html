<p>"I ordered cookies for my wedding and they were beautiful! Kayla had lots of creative options for me, and made my vision come out better than I could imagine. Plus they were delicious, I would highly recommend!"</p>
<p>"I ordered cookies from Kayla for a &ldquo;Friends&rdquo;-themed bridal shower. Kayla worked with me to develop ideas for the variety of cookies and personalized them for the bride! From the icing that was picture-perfect to the exciting and fun experience working with Kayla, these delicious sugar cookies were the star of the event!"</p>
<p>"Kayla made cookies for <a title="Sip And See" href="gallery.html#sipandsee">our son's baby shower</a>. They were beautiful and decorated with great detail... not to mention they were delicious!"</p><a href="gallery.html#sipandsee"><img title="Baby Shower Cookie"

<p>"My family has had cookies made by Kayla for several parties in the past, so for my sister&rsquo;s Bridal Shower she was the obvious choice! Kayla&rsquo;s cookies are consistently delicious and also look fabulous, down to literally the smallest of details. Kayla is also extremely reliable and I know I can count on her to make any occasion extra special and sweet!"</p>
<p>"Kayla made cookies for my bridal shower last spring, and I don&rsquo;t know how she does it! The cookies look so much like beautiful decorations, but are so delicious at the same time! She designed half of these cookies as a calendar with a heart around the day of the wedding - I couldn&rsquo;t believe how perfect it was! I still have one of them saved so I&rsquo;ll never forget!"</p>
